Key Features
1. Collaborative Learning Zones
DeepGaze enhances group learning through real-time collaboration tools.
How It Works:
Step 1: Create a Room ‚Üí Users initiate a shared virtual workspace powered by Socket.io and WebRTC.
Step 2: Scan Resources ‚Üí Each member scans their hardware or uploads images.
Step 3: AI-Generated Project Suggestions ‚Üí Open-source LLMs (Llama) analyze scanned materials and suggest projects.
Project Development Options:
Collaborate, Design & Learn ‚Äì Use Excalidraw API for collaborative circuit design while interactive instructions and AI-based guidance help users in real time.
Collaborative Coding ‚Äì Users transition to Gitpod for coding, then test their implementations individually on Wokwi API.
Continue with Queries ‚Äì Users engage with AI tutors for personalized guidance.
Live Execution Results: Team members can monitor real-time progress of hardware simulations.
2. Gamification: AI-Powered Learning from Surroundings üöÄ
DeepGaze integrates game-based learning strategies to enhance engagement, especially for freshers.
How It Works:
AI-Driven Object Detection (YOLO/MobileNet) recognizes IoT components and everyday objects.
Dynamic Learning Content: Scanning an Arduino suggests beginner-friendly IoT projects.
Skill-Based Challenges for Freshers:
Locked Lab Challenge ‚Äì Use ESP32 and relays to ‚Äúunlock‚Äù the door.
Power Cut Scenario ‚Äì Build a backup LED system.
Water Crisis Mode ‚Äì Implement a smart water level alert.
